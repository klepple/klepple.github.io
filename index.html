<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>
My name is Kahlia Lepple and I am a second year software engineering student at the University of Western Ontario.
I am currently focusing on understanding on how to develop and use algorithms, improving my skills in Java-related areas and implementing the object-oriented methodology in most (if not all) of my progamming projects.
</p>
<p>
As this website clearly demonstrates, I have little interest in web design. My heart belongs to back-end application development and databases.

Aside from programming, I like to spend my days learning more Korean, a language that I have been self-studying for two years. 저는 더 배우고싶어요. I also dabble in art and writing, as well as learning sick jams on my ukulele. Music is an essential component to my life.
</p>
<p>
I hope to someday be able to move to a new country and diversify my life experiences through travel and self-discovery.

<p>
Thanks for stopping by! :)
