<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>
My name is Kahlia Lepple and I am a second year software engineering student at the University of Western Ontario.
I am currently focusing on improving my skills in Java-related areas, object-oriented thinking and developing user-friendly interfaces.

<p>
As this website clearly demonstrates, I have little interest in web design. My heart belongs to back-end application development and databases.
